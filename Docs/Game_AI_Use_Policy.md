# Game AI Use Policy

## Purpose
This policy defines concrete rules for how AI tools may be used during Cinder Village game development, production, and release. It focuses on practical usage boundaries and production clarity.

Unless explicitly allowed below, AI usage is considered **disallowed by default**.

---

## Global Requirements
- All AI-assisted outputs must be **human-reviewed and approved** before shipping.
- Developers must fully understand and take responsibility for anything that ships.
- AI may assist, but **humans own all final decisions**.

---

## 1. Visual Art & Assets (2D, 3D, UI, VFX)

### Allowed
- Ideation and visual exploration
- Temporary placeholders for prototypes
- Blockouts, silhouettes, layout, and composition studies

### Not Allowed
- AI-generated final art assets of any kind
- AI assets with minimal or cosmetic rework (e.g., simple paint-overs)
- AI-generated assets shipped in-game or stored as final content

### Requirements
- All final visual assets must be created by human artists
- AI-generated art must be clearly labeled as **placeholder or reference only**

---

## 2. Audio, Sound Effects, and Music

### Allowed
- Ideation and exploration where applicable

### Not Allowed
- AI-generated final sound effects
- AI-generated final music

### Notes
- This project contains **no voice-over (VO)** content
- Any AI-assisted audio must be removed before final delivery

---

## 3. Writing, Narrative, and Player-Facing Text

### Allowed
- Brainstorming and ideation
- Iteration and rewriting of human-authored text
- AI-generated text used as final assets

### Requirements
- All written content must be **manually reviewed and explicitly approved by a human**
- Humans retain authorship responsibility for all shipped text

---

## 4. Code and Technical Work

### Allowed
- Broad use of AI for coding assistance
- Prototyping, refactoring, debugging, and optimization
- Architecture suggestions and alternatives

### Requirements
- All shipped code must be reviewed and approved by a human developer
- Developers must fully understand any code that ships
- **Final architecture decisions must be made by humans**

### Not Allowed
- Shipping code that the developer cannot explain or maintain

---

## 5. Design, Systems, Balance, and Economy

### Allowed
- Ideation and conceptual exploration
- Testing support and iteration
- Analysis and tuning assistance

### Requirements
- System and gameplay architecture must be designed by developers
- AI may assist but may not autonomously define systems
- All design decisions must be human-guided and approved

---

## 6. Marketing, Store Presence, and External Communications

### Allowed
- General advice and ideation
- Writing and editing of marketing copy

### Not Allowed
- AI-generated art assets
- AI-generated screenshots or video
- AI-generated materials where real gameplay should be shown

### Requirements
- All visuals must come from the actual game where applicable
- All marketing decisions require human approval

---

## 7. Data Usage and AI Inputs

### Allowed
- Use of game analytics data for diagnostics and game design assistance
- Use of AI tools for analysis based on non-PII data

### Not Allowed
- Collection or use of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Inputting PII into AI tools under any circumstances

### Notes
- No restrictions on AI tools if data is used in compliance with this section
- Data use must remain limited to diagnostics and design support

---

## Third-Party and Upstream AI Inputs
We will make a best-effort attempt to ensure that third-party contributions, tools, and upstream content used in development align with the intent of this policy.

However, due to:
- The complexity of AI tool supply chains
- Limited visibility into third-party AI training data and workflows
- Evolving industry standards and the early-stage nature of AI governance

Full guarantees of compliance across the entire chain of custody may not always be possible.

Where uncertainties exist, teams should prioritize transparency, documentation, and risk reduction, and escalate concerns when appropriate.

---

## Policy Changes and Transparency
This policy may change over time as AI tools, workflows, and industry standards evolve.

When changes are made:
- Updates will be documented
- The reason for each change will be noted
- The team will be informed of material revisions

We will make a best-effort attempt to remain **transparent about how AI is used in this game**, both internally and, where appropriate, externally.

Transparency and clarity are considered core requirements of responsible AI usage on this project.
