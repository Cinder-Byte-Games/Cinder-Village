# Cinder Village

**Cinder Village** is a small top-down 2D village prototype built in Unity using pixel art assets inspired by classic Japanese RPGs.

The project is intentionally limited in scope and focuses on clean architecture, reusable systems, and strong Unity fundamentals rather than content scale.

## What This Project Is

- A calm, self-contained village experience  
- One main outdoor area with at least one interior  
- Simple interactions with NPCs, items, and the environment  
- A lightweight inventory and quest system  
- Basic save / load persistence  

Cinder Village is designed as a **learning-first, systems-driven project**, not a full commercial game.

---

## Project Goals

- Learn Unity’s core systems through a complete, playable project  
- Practice prefab-driven and data-driven architecture  
- Build reusable foundations for future 2D games  
- Keep scope small, understandable, and maintainable  

---

## What This Project Is Not

- Not a full RPG or farming simulator  
- Not a Stardew Valley–scale game  
- Not content-heavy or combat-focused  

Features are added only when they reinforce core Unity concepts.

## Status

Active development as a structured learning project.
